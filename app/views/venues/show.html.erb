					<p>Our Festival is hosted by South Mill Arts (formerly the Rhodes Arts Complex) in Bishops Stortford. The 2019 Festival was held here and the venue had incredible feedback from concert-goers.</p>
					<p>It was a regular venue for British jazz in the 50s and 60s, presenting gigs by Tubby Hayes, Humphrey Lyttleton, Acker Bilk, Chris Barber, Ken Colyer, George Melly and many more. We are proud to be continuing a great tradition.</p>
